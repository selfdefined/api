Rather than a direct translation, however, the implication and subtext of these terms is one of prejudice and discrimination. Using the term phobia falsely masks hate as fear.\n\nAdditionally, people with anxiety disorders and mental illness can also experience phobias, so conflating prejudice and discrimination (attitudes and behaviours that can be changed) with medical conditions that cannot be changed additionally harms people who experience phobias from their anxiety disorders.\n\nAs such, using the term phobia removes the responsibility from those who exhibit prejudice and discrimination as it implies it is outside of their control.\n\n## Impact\n\nHateful actions of prejudice and discrimination are unfairly conflated with mental illness. It can create a false parallel where one could imply that actual phobias are something that can be controlled, which harms people who experience actual phobias.\n\nMeanwhile, people exhibiting prejudice and discrimination are given excuses for their bigoted behaviour and not held accountable for their actions.\n\n## Preferable To\n\n-phobia\n",

A perfect lingual weapon for warmongers and racists alike. Equally repulsive sibling of \"savage\".\n\n## Impact\n\nWhen you use words, that are in vogue primarily inside circles of bigots, with racist etymologies, it's a wilful act of violence, ignorance and an indication to the vilified and minoritised communities that their history of wounds and abuses are inconsequential to our words.\n\n## Usage Tip\n\nAvoid words that have obscene etymologies.

Other terms for Boogaloo include: _boog, boojahideen, big igloo, and big luau_.\n\nThe co-opted use of “Boogaloo” is a [dog-whistle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics), used to communicate about, and signal support for militias inciting violence to escalate and accelerate violent uprisings against the government. Part of electing to use this term, as well as Hawaiian shirts and igloos is to avoid existing automated content flags used on social media sites.\n\nIts usage is derived from memes about the film _Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo_, riffing on the title – notably, as “Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo”. Appending “Electric Boogaloo” to other concepts as a joke was born in and largely popularized by early internet message boards such as Something Awful and 4chan.\n\nSome Alt-Right members self-identify as \"Boogaloo Boys\" (or \"Bois\"), or speak of \"preparing / showing up for the Boogaloo\". Many dress in Hawaiian shirts and/or military wear to distinguish themselves at protests and gatherings. One effect of wearing the Hawaiian shirt is to co-opt the public’s existing notions about Hawaiian culture with peaceful, impartial observation, and not radical militarism.\n\n## Issues\n\nSimilarly to the [OK Hand symbol](/definitions/ok-hand), the word itself does not have racist origins (and in fact, is a product of the Latinx music community) and neither does the original meme (a joke about movie sequels). However, language evolves, and \"Boogaloo\" has become a term used quite seriously by Alt-Right and White Supremacist communities.\n\nIt should be noted that this approach of indoctrinating symbols of hate is one long-documented, and [used for the Swastika as well](https://theconversation.com/how-nazis-twisted-the-swastika-into-a-symbol-of-hate-83020)\n\n## Related symbols\n\nBoth the Hawaiian shirt and Igloo snow huts are associated with Indigenous cultures. Before being co-opted by the Boogaloo movement, both symbols were co-opted by American popular culture.\n\nHawaiian shirts were popularized by the Tiki culture movement, created after American military returned from being stationed in the South Pacific during World War II. Due to a lack of including and elevating Polynesian people in the movement, it is considered to be both cultural appropriation and colonial nostalgia.\n\n## Impact\n\nAlthough this was previously a non-violent / non-hateful meme, continuing to use it supports the plausible deniability of those who do use it with serious intent. Those who are most vulnerable will not know your intent, and therefore will feel the impact of hurt and fear, regardless.\n",

    "content": "\n\nclumsy, foolish, unattractive, or otherwise unintelligent act or person.\n\n## Related Words\n\nderp, derp face, herp derp, hurr durr\n\n## Issues\n\nDerpy is very commonly used as an adjective to describe someone's clumsy or foolish behavior, occasionally that of the speaker themselves. Sometimes it is used as a direct replacement of the [r-word](https://www.selfdefined.app/definitions/r-word/).\n\nIt is also used to describe someone else's physical features as unattractive or akin to someone with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In imagery, derpy or a so-called \"derp face\", is often signified by crossed eyes, a stuck out tongue, or permanent facial differences.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe word \"derp\" found its first known use in the 1998 film __Baseketball__ by the creators of the American animated sitcom, __South Park__, and later in __South Park__ itself in the name of the character [\"Mr Derp\"](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Derp). The creators of the show have expressed that the term is uttered when one \"screws up\". In these early uses the word is interchangeable with the words \"duh\", \"hur\" and \"dur\" that came before it, and may have directly or indirectly originated from them.\n\nThe word evolved in 4chan and other forums and began being associated with memes, where the \"derpy\" imagery began. It is there where it became associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/IDD) specifically, as people started overlaying \"derp\" over photographs of children with I/DD.\n\n## Impact\n\nRegardless of whether derpy is being used to describe yourself, or someone with or without an I/DD or physical disability, use of the word contributes to the dehumanisation, stigmatisation, and negative perceptions of people with an I/DD or physical (especially facial) differences.\n\nBy using ableist language, we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental, developmental, or physical disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm, regardless of our intent.\n\n## Usage Tip\n\nBe more specific. Typically we can find an alternate definition by taking time to reflect on what emotion we're really feeling. If you are describing a person's silly actions or expressions use a more relevant, descriptive word.\n\nIf you are using it to describe or refer to a person's disability or physical difference, don't.\n",

Rarely are Black characters given subtle feelings, emotion or actions. Additionally, power comes into it as a non-Black person is using a Black person as a mask (hence where the minstrelsy comes in).\n\nDigital Blackface is also an issue of representation and culture appropriation: memes and gifs are often used in spaces where no real Black people are present, which presents them as a prop to be used in all-white spaces. Black culture is stolen from Black people and commodified by non-Black people.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Online personas: It can go further than appropration. Falsified personas are easy to spot as they almost always use terms like \"as a black woman...\" [sic] and resort to incorrect and illegitimate use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE).[1](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/your-slip-is-showing-4chan-trolls-operation-lollipop)\n\n  \"On Twitter lie countless handles featuring a Black person’s image, run by users who are most assuredly not Black. These accounts, which often include a “ghetto” name — the formula prefix “La+” is a favored trope — are riddled with poor attempts at Black vernacular, and feature stereotypes from the minstrel stage.\" [2](https://www.theawl.com/2014/08/memes-and-misogynoir/)\n\n- Gifs\n\n  \"For while reaction GIFs can and do every feeling under the sun, white and nonblack users seem to especially prefer GIFs with black people when it comes to emitting their most exaggerated emotions. Extreme joy, annoyance, anger and occasions for drama and gossip are a magnet for images of black people, especially black femmes.\" [1](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/digital-blackface-reaction-gifs)\n\n- Emojis (using a darker-than-your-own skin-tone, especially when you are white)[1](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/03/21/425573955/white-skin-black-emojis)[2](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/01/thoughts-on-white-people-using-dark-skinned-emoji/)\n\n- Simple actions like using dark toned emoji in text or social media posts\n\n## What To Do (instead)\n\nIf you are not Black, before using a Black person's identity to express or convey an idea, take a moment to reflect upon what you're doing and what message you're trying to convey. In most situations, you would probably be better off picking a gif or meme of a non-Black person, better yet, of a race you identify with.\n",

    "content": "\n\ncolloquially, a man; a discourse marker expressing masculine solidarity; an expression of astonishment when used alone\n\n## Issues\n\n\"Dude\" was originally used to refer to a man who paid a lot of attention to his appearance, but became more broadly used to describe any man as part of African American Vernacular English in the 1960s. It was subsequently appropriated by white men in the 1980s, particularly on the West Coast, and has since grown to be used broadly by white men and women as a noun as well as a discourse marker.\n\nWhen used as a discourse marker, it carries the connotation that the speaker believes that they are speaking to a man; however, as both a discourse marker and a noun, it is frequently used without regard for the gender or pronouns of listeners.\n\n## Impact\n\nRegardless of the intent of the speaker, prefacing a statement with \"dude\" risks misgendering its audience and perpetuating a culture that favors traditional masculinity as the baseline for gender. Proponents of using \"dude\" commonly defend its usage aggressively by claiming that they use it in a gender-neutral way (which is not possible) and that anyone negatively impacted by its usage is wrong for not accepting that and chooses to apply the gendered interpretation. The argument fails to acknowledge that society dictates and reinforces gender, regardless of the individual interpretation. The ubiquity of that argument often deters those who are negatively impacted from bringing attention to the usage of \"dude\" as their experiences are often [gaslighted](/definitions/gaslighting).\n\n## Alt Words Mindfulness Note\n\nBefore using colloquial terms of endearment, it's important to be mindful of power and context. While our intent may be to make people feel at ease or comfortable, we can have the opposite effect. For example, \"buddy\" or \"pal\" from an older person to younger person or a manager to employee can feel infantilising or pejorative; this becomes exacerbated because of the power differential in the relationship. The person in less power often isn't in a position to correct. There's no one-size-fits-all model; instead we should seek to address people with consent first and course correct. It's not about getting it perfect at first, it's about getting it right in the end.\n",

Medical professionals hold fatphobic biases and often prescribe weight loss as a default instead of listening to their fat patients' concerns.\n\nEmployers will pay fat employees less than their thin colleagues and offer them no protection from weight stigma in the workplace, as their fatphobic biases lead to their perception of fat employees as lazy, less intelligent, and unmotivated.\n\nLaw enforcement officers are less likely to believe fat people reporting sexual assaults, as their fatphobic biases lead them to think of fat people as unattractive, not sexually active, or undesirable.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile fatphobia is a more widely known term, many prefer fatmisia, as [-misia] means hate or hatred of, which more accurately describes the prejudice and discrimination.\n",

(It has since been disbanded into other disorders, such as conversion and disassociative disorders.) So, as medical professionals believed men did not have uteruses\\*, medical professionals would not diagnose men with hysteria (even though they were experiencing the same symptoms of conversion disorder).\n\n\\*Editor's Note: This concept that men cannot have uteruses is reflective of the medical context, not the belief of the editor.\n\n## Impact\n\nGender-codified and sexist language perpetuates harmful stereotypes that reinforce patriarchical ideas. In the case of hysteria, it perpetuates the false stereotype of women as being unreasonable, irrational, and not in control of their emotions. Harmful stereotypes can cause women to not be believed, to have their experiences invalidated, and be tone-policed.\n\nDefining gender by sexual organs can also perpetuate transphobic and anti-trans definitions, where gender is falsely defined by sexual organs.\n\nMedical conditions believed to be defined by sex and gender are reductive and can lead to misdiagnosis.\n\n## Alt Words\n\nIf intending **funny** connotation, try: funny; hilarious; comedic.\n\nIf intending **panic** connotation, try: panicked, petrified, startled.\n",

Yet, this type of offensive language is still used casually in many programming languages.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe outdated \"master/slave\" convention has strong associations with slavery which is exclusionary to members of our community who may continue to live with the negative impacts of slavery. It also demonstrates how pervasive and casual racism is throughout our culture and language.\n\n## Usage Tip\n\nSeek to change any existing \"master/slave\" terminology to one of the suggested terms, as there are many alternative terminologies to describe the relationship between two components, many of which are much more specific. Avoid creating new projects with this terminology.\n\nEven if you may not be negatively impacted by this terminology, it can negatively impact other existing and prospective contributors onto your project. The terminology isn't so unique that it's irreplaceable; the lift tends to be trivial in comparison to the potential impact.\n",

It was framed as a hoax to \"own\" Leftists through trickery and [gaslighting](/definitions/gaslighting).\n\nThe hand gesture has been used by White Supremacists as a dogwhistle to identify other White Supremacists [at rallies](https://mashable.com/article/milo-yiannopoulos-banned-from-furry-convention/), [in forums](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/09/18/ok-sign-white-power-symbol-or-just-right-wing-troll), and even [at court hearings](https://nypost.com/2019/03/15/suspected-new-zealand-shooter-appears-in-court/). In 2019, the hand gesture was added to the [Anti-Defamation League's list of official symbols of hate](https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/ok-and-other-alt-right-memes-and-slogans-added-to-adls-hate-symbols-database).\n\n## Issues\n\nWhile it can be argued that the symbol's origins and many of its uses do not imply racist connotations, and that the 4chan-ers \"framed it as a hoax,\" it is undeniable that the symbol has evolved and become a gesture used sincerely by white supremacists.\n\nThe uncertainty created by the 4chan-ers is a critical part of their strategy. The strategy employs plausible deniability: Because they self-identified it as a hoax, they can fall back on that explanation. Meanwhile, if people begin to adapt the symbol, as they did, it becomes a dogwhistle for White Supremacists. It should be noted that this approach of indoctrinating symbols of hate is one long-documented, and [used for the Swastika as well](https://theconversation.com/how-nazis-twisted-the-swastika-into-a-symbol-of-hate-83020).\n\n## Impact\n\nThe people most vulnerable to the oppressive impact of White Supremacy will never know for certain if the symbol is being used in one of its non-violent manners or if it's being used in its racist violent manners. The oppressed must choose the option that protects them, which is typically erring on the side of caution.\n\nContinuing to use the symbol with its non-hateful connotations to \"take it back,\" does not eliminate its pervasive new meaning associated with White Supremacy. Instead, continuing usage only perpetuates emotional and psychological harm upon the most vulnerable and susceptible populations.\n\n## Other Languages\n\n[Français](/definitions/fr_FR/signe-ok)\n",

Before microphones and opera glasses were common, balcony seats were the least desireable in Vaudeville theaters and were typically where Black people sat.

Phrases such as \"no comments from the peanut gallery\" or \"quiet in the peanut gallery\" are extensions of the name.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe phrase implies that the opinions expressed by those from the gallery were unsolicited, unwarranted and unhelpful, which then perpetrates that Black people's critiques are irrelevant or insignificant. This is particularly problematic when they are critiquing oppressive systems and their oppressors. Using such terms perpetuate the imbalance of power and the delegitimisation of their critiques.\n\nBy continuing the use of the term, rooted in its subordination to white power structures, regardless of whether we intend to carry its racist origins or not, we are contributing to the perpetuating of harm against Black people and their voices. Seemingly small actions like this contribute to the normalisation of the harm.\n\nDenying the etymology or power of the word as irrelevant is denying the history of its strength: \"Peanut gallery\" has been used to dehumanise Black people and their voices, which leads to justify oppressing them or denying their rights.\n\n## Usage Tip\n\nConsider context and the power you possess in an interaction.

If you can, it's best to ask them one-on-one in a private setting. If you can't, likely they'll tell you the pronouns that make sense for that public setting.\n\n**Sometimes people will list their pronouns on their websites, email signatures, social media bios, etc.** While you can refer to those places for usage, it generally doesn't hurt to confirm how _you_ should refer to the person _in the particular context_, as some people use different pronouns in different settings. (For example, someone might not feel comfortable using a set of pronouns that might \"out them\" (reveal aspects of their gender identity) in a place they don't feel safe doing so.\n\n**When you are not sure and unable to confirm (such as if the person is deceased), it's generally best to use they/them pronouns.** However, note that some people do not like the use of they/them pronouns, which is sometimes the case for someone who has to work very hard to match their perceived gender identity to their pronouns.\n\nIf it seems complicated, it is because it is. Pronouns can be really important to people as they can represent a lot to a person about their identity. It's best to try your hardest then course-correct as needed.\n\n## Tips for Asking\n\nKeeping your question simple usually is best:\n\n\"What pronoun(s) should I use for you [add context if it's beyond one on one usage, including who might see it]?\"\n\nAvoid adding extra words, like, \"[preferred pronoun](/definitions/preferred-pronoun)\" or \"[gender pronoun](/definitions/gender-pronouns)\"\n\n## Tips for Correction\n\n**If you get someone's pronouns wrong and you're alerted of it or realise, correct the pronoun, apologise swiftly, and move on.** Avoid dwelling on it (providing long back story or berating yourself and expecting them to console you).\n\nIt can be very uncomfortable for whom you used the wrong pronoun, as it can often mean misgendering them. When you dwell on your mistake, you're asking someone who just had an uncomfortable, potentially oppressive experience, to then console you. Gross.\n\n**If you notice someone use the wrong pronouns for someone, correct the pronoun.** \"Jack uses they/them pronouns.\" Be certain that you are sure that the person would want you to use these pronouns in this setting, as you can accidentally \"out\" somebody if you're not careful.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Usually people will list the pronouns as they/them or they/them/theirs.\n- Some people use multiple pronouns, such as she/they or they/he. Sometimes the order of these can imply which pronoun they use more frequently or if there is a slight preference to one over the other. It can also sometimes imply that they are in transition between using one pronoun to another. It can also imply none of these things, so it is best not to assume.\n- Some people change their pronouns based on settings. For example, if someone is transitioning and does not want to be outed in one setting, they may use different pronouns in that setting. Hence, why it is important to follow someone's lead and to confirm usage based on context.\n- They/them is a singular pronoun and has been since the late 1300s, so if someone tries to tell you that it's only plural, it's unlikely they take issue with the grammar but with something else.\n- Some plural people will refer to themselves as \"we\" to represent their plural identities.\n\n## Places to Put Pronouns\n\nGenerally speaking, whereever your name appears, including your pronouns is a good place to do so. The website [pronoun.is](https://pronoun.is) is helpful as it appends someone's pronouns to a link, and gives explanation to pronoun usage. You may see people include this in their various bios.\n\nSome ideas of places to put pronouns include:\n\n- Conference talks/webinars\n- Email signatures\n- Introductions (If you're introducing two or more people, make sure you confirm their pronouns if you're not certain)\n- Nametags\n- Social media bios\n- Video conference name fields\n- Websites\n\n## Impact\n\nBy respecting others' pronouns, asking them for consent, and sharing our own pronouns, we can normalise this step in socialisation. Doing so causes us to pause before presuming someone's pronouns. When people presume pronouns, it can lead to misgendering, which causes harm toward people, particularly trans and non-binary folks.\n\nIt is particularly important for people whose gender presentation and identity aligns with their pronouns to take this step, as they have the most power to influence society.\n\n## Read Also\n\n[gender pronouns](/definitions/gender-pronouns)\n[preferred pronoun](/definitions/preferred-pronoun)\n",

Changes are being made in both the medical and legal fields to reflect that conversational shift.\n\n[Rosa's Law was passed in 2010](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ256/PLAW-111publ256.pdf) to eliminate all references to \"mental retardation\" in U.S. federal law, replacing them with \"intellectual disability\".\n\nThe [DSM-5 update in 2013](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf) replaced \"mental retardation\" with \"intellectual disability\". [The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/feedback-and-questions/frequently-asked-questions) is the handbook used by health care professionals in the United States and much of the world as the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. The DSM is [periodically revised](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf) to align the manual's content with modern language and in reflection of the most up-to-date research and diagnostic criteria.\n\n## Impact\n\nRegardless of whether r-word is being used to describe someone with or without an I/DD, use of the word contributes to the dehumanisation, stigmatisation, and negative perceptions of people with an I/DD.\n\nBy using ableist language, we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental or psychological disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm, regardless of our intent.\n\n## Alt Words\n\nIf you are using it to describe or refer to a person with an I/DD in a context where their I/DD is relevant, first be certain that they have an I/DD. Use a term that does not have a derogatory connotation (\"intellectual disability\", or the name of the actual disability, if applicable). If you use the name of the actual disability, be certain that you are correct, and be certain that they are comfortable with using the name.\n\nIf you are using it to describe or refer to a person with an I/DD in a context where their I/DD is not relevant, don't. Describe something else about them as a person. if someone is writing an article about a person with an I/DD, the relevance of their I/DD should be led by them. Avoid \"inspiration porn\", which is the portrayal of people with disabilities as inspirational solely or in part on the basis of their disability. ([Coined by Stella Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxrS7-I_sMQ)).\n\nIf you are using it to describe or refer to a person without an I/DD, don't. Use a different, more relevant, descriptive word.\n",

The concept of the savage gave Europeans the supposed right to establish colonies without considering the possibility of preexisting, functional societies.\"[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage).\n\nThe term savage is deeply rooted in settler colonialism, used primarily to justify colonisation by dehumanising Indigenous people, in particular, with regard to North American Indigenous peoples.\n\nThe theories behind the \"noble savage\" led to scientific racism. [Boarding schools](https://eji.org/history-racial-injustice-cultural-genocide) were constructed to separate Indigenous children from their parents, becuase white colonisers didn't believe that they were equipped to be parents.\n\n“When the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages; he is surrounded by savages, and though he may learn to read and write his habits, and training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read and write … [T]he Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.”[2](https://eji.org/history-racial-injustice-cultural-genocide)\n\n## Impact\n\nBy continuing to use this word, rooted in colonist history and context, while Indigenous people's lands are still being occupied and unceded, while more and more Indigenous women and girls continue to go missing, we are perpetuating a word that has been used to justify the past and the ongoing harm we commit against Indigenous peoples. Seemingly small actions like this contribute to the normalisation of the harm.\n\nDenying the etymology or power of the word as irrelevant is denying the history of its strength: Savage has been used to dehumanise Indigenous people in order to justify oppressing them or granting them fewer rights. The justifications have even included Supreme Court cases.\n\nThe imagery associated with the \"savage\" is used to justify oppressive and systematic racism against Indigenous peoples; that they somehow deserve injustice because it is their own fault.\n\n## Considerations\n\nRihanna has a lingerie line called Savage by Fenty. Megan Thee Stallion has a song called \"Savage.\"\n\nThe intersection of oppression of Black and Indigenous cultures is one worth noting. [Gwen Benaway's piece, Rihanna’s Lingerie Line Brings Up a Complicated Discussion About Language](https://www.flare.com/fashion/rihanna-savage-fenty-lingerie/) addresses this complexity: \"As much as we like clear right and wrongs with easy retweetable hot takes, some issues—like the dialogue about savage between Indigenous and Black communities—isn’t one to simplify.\"\n",

Motivation for suicide can be the result of conscious or unconscious thoughts and feelings.\n\n## Common Issues\n\nCommonly referred to in conversation and journalism as \"committed suicide\", \"took their own life\", or similar, which can have negative connotations with criminality and judgement, and can place blame on the individual.\n\nCan also be used in combination with a related measure of \"success\" which promotes suicide as a desirable result.\n\nSuicide is sometimes used colloquially to mean something will severely negatively impact you (e.g., \"social suicide\" and \"career suicide\"). Replace \"career suicide\" with \"career-ending,\" which conveys the same intent. Replace \"social suicide\" with a  complete rephrase where you avoid placing blame on the individual: \"Doing this will negatively impact your social life.\"\n\n## Impact\n\nUnless used with sensitivity and care, discussion of suicide can reinforce negative stereotypes and stigma around mental illness. Sensationalist reporting of suicide also risks inadvertently promoting suicide.\n\n## Usage Tips\n\nWhen discussing suicide and suicidal ideation:\n\n- Avoid mentioning details of methods used and suggesting that these are \"easy\" or \"painless\" to reduce the risk of imitation.\n- Avoid suggesting that suicide is an \"easy way out\".\n- Avoid speculation over possible triggers: Suicide and suicidal ideation is complex and not necessarily the result of a single event or condition. Attempting to explain away suicide with a specific cause or condition downplays the wider circumstances and the impact on all those affected.\n- Instead of saying that a person \"committed suicide\", say that a person \"died by suicide.\" Framing suicide as a symptom of wider/unknown-to-us conditions validates the individual as a victim, rather than a perpetrator.\n- Discussing or reporting on suicide can be an opportunity to signpost the support available and educate people about the importance of mental wellbeing.\n- Include local resources for people to gain help, such as links to suicide hotlines, mental health resources, etc. Ensure these resources are appropriately linked for ease of use (e.g., ensure telephones are linked with `tel` tags, for example).\n- Follow [Reporting on Suicide](https://reportingonsuicide.org/)'s guidelines (or similar linked resources below), especially if your reporting will be largely publicised.\n",

For example, an issue might specifically be relevant to Black folks, but by referring to the group as URM, it erases their Blackness, conflates/waters down issues, and reinforces the power dynamic of white and everyone else.\n\nURM can also imply that the group in question isn't \"showing up\" to be represented; that the burden is on the URM group to show up or to do more to improve their numbers and representation. Meanwhile, the complement, the overrepresented majority, tends to be unnamed.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy naming the underrepresented minority often without the overrepresented majority, we are often reinforcing the idea that people harmed by oppressive systems are on the hook to fix them.\n\nBy repeatedly referring to groups as \"[minorities](/definitions/minorities),\" they are being infantilised to their numerical representation and made to feel minor. The vagueness also abstracts the identify of the marginalised group, making it difficult to address why they are minoritised to begin with and often erasing the complexity of those intersections.\n\n## Usage\n\nWhen using any term for a group, it's important to contextualise it into people. So, for example, \"people from the underrepresented minorities are more likely to be affected by this change\" over \"the underrepresented minority are more likely to be affected by this change.\"\n\nAdditionally, it's important to examine the context of the usage:\n\n- Why are you placing focus on the URM groups?\n- Will you also be speaking of the role overrepresented majorities play as well?\n- Would examining and speaking of overrepresented majorities be more accurate to your context?\n- Is URM accurate?\n- If no, can you be more specific than URM?\n\n## Read also\n\n- [minorities](/definitions/minorities)\n- [minoritised](/definitions/minoritised)\n- [overrepresented majority](/definitions/overrepresented-majority)\n",

Furthermore, every white woman is empowered to use it to reinforce the power of the white supremecist capitalist patriarchy.\n\n- For a white woman to not be a white feminist, they must engage in actively dismantling their unearned privilege and fight their engrained nature. This usually involves learning how to become anti-racist, anti-ableist, anti-transmisic, etc.\n\n- While it is not a white feminist's _fault_ that they were born into, indoctrinated with, and socialised to use white feminist tools, it is their _responsibility_ to examine and to unpack the harm they can intentional and unintentionally commit. Just like it's not minoritised women's fault that they were born into bodies that are harmed by white feminism.\n\n- White feminists can come in any gender, ability, race, orientation, nationality. White men benefit from supporting white feminism and white feminists, as it supports white supremacy. For Black/brown folks, the white feminism may take a form of internalised oppression and require a decolonialisation of self to understand.\n\n- Other forms of oppression do not negate this white privilege. So, a disabled white woman still is indoctrinated with the power of and benefits from white feminism and white privilege, at the harm of Black/brown disabled women. Same goes for size-privilege, etc.\n\n## Impact\n\nBlack/brown women's issues become secondary and subordinate to the needs of white women. White feminism only advances white women, and often at the harm of Black and brown women and minoritised genders. In fact, often, once the needs of white women are met, Black/brown women are left behind.\n\nWhite feminism destroys the work against integrated and intersectional dismantling of the white supremecist capitalis patriarchy and kyriarchy.\n\n## What To Do\n\nIf you suspect you might be a white feminist, examine your brand of feminism.\n\n- What privileges do you possess that other women do not?\n- How have you reinforced the systems of oppression (intentionally or unintentionally)?\n- When reading feminist texts or thinking of feminist icons, who are you centring? Who is missing?\n\nIf you are white, examine your own [white fragility](/definitions/white-fragility). Reading Black feminist and womanist texts by authors like Angela Davis, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde is a good place to start.\n\n## Editor's Notes\n\n[Non-binary](/definitions/non-binary), agender, gender non-conforming, and other gender minoritised people are often neglected in traditional feminist rhetoric. In this entry, we've explicitly not conflated and used the term \"non-binary people and women\" as many non-binary people do not like being lumped in with women. Exploring the nuance between even Black/brown women and Black/brown non-binary people, as one example, requires separate subtext beyond the scope of this singular definition.\n\nIn our definition of women, we include trans women, because trans women are women.\n",

The cost of white fragility is that it centres the feelings of white people while ignoring and invalidating the systemic harm conducted towards people of colour. White fragility also prevents white people from doing anti-racist work to unpack their socially internalised racism.\n",
